# Local Epidemic Forecasting on Networks

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for the paper "Epidemic Forecasting on Networks: Bridging Local Samples with Global Outcomes".


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages (install via pip):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:

   git clone [your-repository-url]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd [project-directory]
   ```

## Usage

### Running Epidemic Forecasting Experiments
1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the running_algorithm notebooks in your browser
